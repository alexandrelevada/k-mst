# Shape operator based minimum spanning tree clustering for nonlinear data
Minimum spanning tree (MST)-based clustering methods are attractive due to their simplicity and ability to capture non-convex cluster structures; however, they are often sensitive to noise, boundary effects, and non-uniform sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel curvature-aware MST-based clustering method, termed k-MST, which incorporates local geometric information to improve clustering robustness and accuracy. The proposed approach first constructs a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph from the data and estimates local curvatures by approximating the shape operator at each sample point. These curvature estimates are then used to reweight the edges of the k-NN graph, yielding a curvature-informed graph that penalizes connections involving high-curvature regions, typically associated with cluster boundaries, edges, or outliers. The minimum spanning tree is subsequently extracted from this graph, and optimal clusterings are obtained by removing edges that minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. The underlying intuition is that low-curvature regions correspond to dense, homogeneous cluster interiors, while high-curvature regions indicate structural transitions in the data manifold. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed k-MST is capable of improving traditional MST-based clustering methods, particularly in scenarios involving non-linear cluster geometries and complex manifold structures.
